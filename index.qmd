## Introduction

My name is Siyao Li (Lillian). I am currently a first year ScM student of Biostatistics at Bloomberg School of Public Health in Johns Hopkins University.

I came from Nanjing, China, which is the capital of China's eastern Jiangsu province. This is also a capital with six dynasties.
