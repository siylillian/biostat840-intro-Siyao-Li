For example, it could be to a website or paper from where the original data came from or it could be to a paper describing a method you are using to analyze the data. \n    - Your analysis must include the use of at least 1 [margin content](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatprogramming2022/posts/2022-10-27-build-website/#margin-content). \n    - You must summarize your analysis and/or results with a paragraph (4-6 sentences).\n    - At the end of the data analysis, list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`) to help the TA with respect to making sure you met all the requirements described above. \n",
