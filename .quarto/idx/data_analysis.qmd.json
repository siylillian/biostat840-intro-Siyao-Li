Both Brisbane and Sydney have the highest temperature in recent years, and the rainfall is less in this two areas also. For the fewest rainfall of five cities is Canberra, and the temperature in this city is also very high. By the news in the Internet[@fire], we can see that there are lots of fire detection or hot-spots in these areas. Therefore, the fire is associated with temperature and rainfall. Although, Melbourne has the lowest temperature and Perth has the most rainfall in these five cities, there are still some fire detection. \n\n### Appendix\n\n**dplyr:**\n\n-   mutate()\n\n-   inner_join()\n\n-   filter()\n\n-   group_by()\n\n-   summarise()\n\n**tidyr:**\n\n-   drop_na()\n\n-   unite()\n\n**ggplot2:**\n\n-   geom_bar()\n\n-   geom_histogram()\n\n-   geom_line()\n\n-   geom_errorbar()\n\n-   facet_wrap()\n\n-   labs()\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"data_analysis.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.258","editor":"visual","theme":"journal","title":"Example Analysis","bibliography":["my-refs.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
